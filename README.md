This repository contains public web experiments by the Cloudflare Workers team.

I have extended this Cloudflare Workers micro-frontend.
- 🔑 Implemented layered cache with KV
- ⚛️ Changed one of the fragments to React (the original uses Qwik)

Furthermore I am currently trying to implement routing and navigation 💪
